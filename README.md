## Post Installation Tips

**Fix ZSH Errors**\
If you are using ZSH as your shell (default in newer Mac OS versions) you may get this error after running the setup script:
 
> zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.\
> Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?

You can fix this by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

**Keeping your tools up-to-date**\
Homebrew can keep your commandline tools and languages up-to-date.
```sh
# List what needs to be updated
brew update
brew outdated
 
# Upgrade a specific app/formula (example: git)
brew upgrade git

# Upgrade everything
brew upgrade
  
# List previous versions installed (example: git)
brew switch git list
 
# Roll back to a currently installed previous version (example: git 2.25.0)
brew switch git 2.25.0
```

## Todo: Prep for M1 compatibility 

- Install Rosetta 2 (Is it not installed by default or automatically?)\
  `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta` \
  or `sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta agree-to-license`

- Set the new M1 location of homebrew up in the path \
  `/opt/homebrew/bin`
